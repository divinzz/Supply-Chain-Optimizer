This project aims to improve supply chain distribution routes by using optimization techniques to make logistics more efficient. The main objective is to reduce transportation costs, shorten delivery times, and improve supply chain management by finding the best routes for shipping goods. The project has two versions with different levels of optimization:

Version 1 (PuLP): This version uses the PuLP library to solve linear programming problems. The goal is to minimize transportation costs by finding the best routes across a network of supply and demand points.

Version 2 (Optimized): Building on Version 1, Version 2 uses more advanced techniques to handle more complex problems. It takes into account additional variables and constraints, offering better solutions for real-world challenges.

Problem Definition: 
Supply chain optimization is essential for efficiently moving products from suppliers (such as factories or ports) to consumers (like retailers or warehouses). The challenge is selecting the best shipping routes while considering factors like transportation costs, travel distances, and time constraints.

In this project, the goal is to determine the most efficient routes for shipping goods. The aim is to reduce transportation costs and delivery times, all while ensuring that constraints like route availability and vehicle capacities are respected.

Tools and Technologies Used: 
Python: This programming language is ideal for handling large datasets and performing complex calculations. It’s used throughout the project for coding the optimization models.
PuLP: PuLP is an open-source library in Python used to define and solve linear programming problems. Version 1 of the project uses PuLP to formulate the supply chain optimization problem.
Pandas: Pandas is a powerful tool for data analysis. It’s used to manage and manipulate supply chain data, such as distances, costs, and inventory levels.
NumPy: This library is used for mathematical operations and numerical computations, which are essential for solving optimization problems.
Matplotlib/Plotly (Optional): These libraries help visualize the results, such as the best routes and the overall supply chain network. This is not required but can make the results more understandable.
Project Methodology
The optimization process uses mathematical programming, mainly linear programming, to determine the best routes. In Version 1, PuLP is used to create a model where the objective is to minimize transportation costs. The model considers constraints like route capacity and delivery times.

Version 2 improves upon this by adding more layers of complexity, such as varying shipping capacities and multi-criteria optimization. This allows for a better balance between minimizing both costs and delivery times.

Challenges and Benefits:

Optimizing supply chain routes is challenging for several reasons:
Multiple variables: Routes must be optimized across different criteria like cost, time, and available capacity.
Large datasets: Supply chain problems often involve significant amounts of data, such as distances, transportation costs, and inventory.
Complex constraints: Constraints like time windows for deliveries, route capacity, and demand fulfillment make the problem even more complicated.
However, optimization has several key benefits:

Cost reduction: By finding the most efficient routes, transportation costs are minimized.
Time savings: Shorter, more efficient routes lead to faster deliveries and improved supply chain efficiency.
Better decision-making: Supply chain managers can make informed decisions by using optimization models that account for all relevant factors.

Future Work:
There are several ways the project can be improved in the future:
Incorporating more variables: Future versions could account for factors like weather, traffic data, or real-time shipping updates.
Scalability: The algorithms can be improved to handle larger datasets or more complex supply chain networks.
Advanced techniques: Integrating advanced algorithms like genetic algorithms or machine learning could help solve complex supply chain problems more efficiently.
Conclusion:
This project shows how optimization techniques can improve supply chain logistics, making them more cost-effective and timely. By using Python and the PuLP library, the project solves a common supply chain route optimization problem. Version 2 refines the solution by considering more complex constraints, offering a better approach to real-world logistics challenges. This project is an excellent way to learn how optimization can solve practical problems faced by supply chain managers.
