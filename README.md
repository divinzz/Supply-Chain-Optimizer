The **Supply Chain Optimization Project** is designed to address the complexities of supply chain management, focusing on optimizing distribution routes to minimize costs and improve overall efficiency. By leveraging mathematical optimization techniques, this project aims to provide businesses with a solution for reducing logistics costs, improving delivery times, and ensuring resource allocation aligns with demand. The project features two versions: the basic optimization approach utilizing **PuLP**, and an enhanced version that includes advanced optimization techniques for improved route selection.

## Version 1: PuLP-based Optimization

The first version of the project utilizes **PuLP**, a Python library for solving linear programming (LP) problems. This version focuses on minimizing transportation costs by determining the most cost-effective shipping routes between different locations within the supply chain. The goal is to reduce the total transportation cost while adhering to constraints such as inventory limits, shipping capacities, and demand at each location.

### How Version 1 Works:
1. **Input Data**: Supply chain data is input into the system, typically in the form of a CSV file containing essential details like distances between various ports, transportation costs, inventory levels, and demand at each destination.
2. **Optimization Process**: The **PuLP library** is used to formulate the problem as a linear programming model. It then computes the optimal solution by solving this model, ensuring that the total transportation cost is minimized and all constraints are respected.
3. **Output**: The result is an optimized set of shipping routes and their corresponding costs. This output allows businesses to understand the most cost-efficient way to transport goods from one location to another.

## Version 2: Advanced Optimization

The second version of the project introduces more advanced optimization techniques to improve upon the basic solution provided in Version 1. This version incorporates additional factors and constraints, such as dynamic delivery windows, traffic conditions, and more complex cost structures. By integrating custom logic and enhanced algorithms, the advanced version seeks to provide more efficient route selections that not only minimize cost but also optimize delivery time and resource utilization.

### How Version 2 Works:
1. **Input Data**: Similar to Version 1, but with additional features like time-sensitive delivery schedules, real-time traffic data, and additional constraints for optimization.
2. **Advanced Optimization Process**: This version uses advanced methods such as heuristics, metaheuristics, or other algorithmic approaches. The goal is to find more precise and optimized routes that address the broader range of supply chain challenges beyond cost minimization alone.
3. **Output**: The output provides optimized routes with reduced transportation costs, improved delivery schedules, and more efficient resource usage.

## Tools Used in the Project:

- **Python**: The primary programming language used to implement the optimization logic.
- **PuLP**: A Python library for linear programming used in Version 1 to solve optimization problems.
- **Pandas**: A data manipulation library that handles tabular data, which is critical for managing the supply chain data.
- **NumPy**: A powerful numerical computation library used to handle large datasets and optimize mathematical calculations during the optimization process.
- **Matplotlib/Plotly (Optional)**: Visualization libraries used to create charts or graphs that display the results of the optimization (e.g., the optimized routes).
- **Google Colab**: A cloud-based environment for coding and running the project. It allows for seamless collaboration and is used for executing the optimization tasks and visualizing the results.

## Project Execution

To execute the project, users can run the following commands in **Google Colab** or any Python environment:

- `!python supply_chain_optimizer.py --version 1`: This runs the basic version using **PuLP** for linear programming optimization.
- `!python supply_chain_optimizer.py --version 2`: This executes the advanced optimization version, incorporating custom logic for more complex optimizations.

## Conclusion

The **Supply Chain Optimization Project** provides a flexible, scalable solution for businesses seeking to streamline their supply chain operations. The **PuLP version** offers a foundational approach for cost-effective routing, while the **advanced version** takes it a step further, considering additional constraints and variables for more efficient solutions. By using **Python**, **PuLP**, and other supporting libraries, this project can be applied to real-world supply chain scenarios to reduce operational costs and improve logistics performance.

With the ability to execute directly in **Google Colab**, this project is easy to set up and run, making it a practical tool for optimization in the logistics industry.
